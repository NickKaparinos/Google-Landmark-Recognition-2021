# Google-Landmark-Recognition-2021
Have you ever gone through your vacation photos and asked yourself: What is the name of this temple I visited in China? Who created this monument I saw in France? Landmark recognition can help! This technology can predict landmark labels directly from image pixels, to help people better understand and organize their photo collections. This competition challenges Kagglers to build models that recognize the correct landmark (if any) in a dataset of challenging test images.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of 1580470 images of 81313 different landmarks.
